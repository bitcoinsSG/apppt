apppt
=====
analysis of permuted protein based peptide t scores


modus operandi
=====================
this repo contains a collection of loosely amalgamated statistical scripts written in R; designed to analyze high-throughput mass spectrometry based proteomic data

novelty
=====================
apppt uses a novel approach to the statistical analysis of differentiated proteins between samples by minimizing the number of assumptions a priori. By evaluating the null hypothesis empirically on a per variable and multi variable level in tandem, apppt discards the trust required on the theoritical distributions and thus provides a highly robust approach to hypothesis testing

motivation/warning
=====================
apppt is not intended for production level real-time analysis, rather a platform from which production level scripts may be constructed


license
=====================
